# VWD_simupop_simulation
This is the code used by the 2023 thesis paper by Maggie Brown, titled "An Evolutionary Perspective on von Willebrand Disease: Modeling the Effects of Natural Selection on the Frequency of von Willebrand Disease-Causing Alleles"

In order to run this code, the simuPOP module must be downloaded. Instructions for download are available at https://simupop.sourceforge.net/. 

While there are multiple different ways that the module can be downloaded, I personally followed the instructions for installation via Anaconda 3. I ran into
difficulties when trying to access the module in PyCharm 2022.3.3, despite simuPOP being seemingly properly installed. However, I had no problems with accessing the 
module in DataSpell 2022.3.3, and thus wrote the code using this IDE. Based on this experience, I would advise anyone trying to run the code use DataSpell if 
they are having troubles.
